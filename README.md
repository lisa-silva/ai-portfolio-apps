# ü§ñ AI Portfolio - Specialized Application Suite

This repository houses three distinct, deployed applications built to showcase proficiency in advanced System Prompt Engineering, Real-Time Data Grounding, and Structured Output Generation using the Google Gemini API.
Technical Stack

    Language: Python

    Framework: Streamlit (UI/Deployment)

    AI/API: Google Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash)

    Core Skills: Real-Time Grounding, JSON Schema Enforcement, Full-Stack Deployment

1. üèõÔ∏è Political Fact-Checker App
Project Goal: Specialized AI for Real-Time Verification

This application transforms the LLM into an impartial, high-fidelity fact-checking tool by enforcing verification against current public data.

    Core Feature: Real-Time Grounding‚ÄîIntegrates the Gemini API with Google Search Grounding to ensure all verification is based on current, verifiable, web-indexed data.

    Analysis Model: Designed a custom System Prompt that enforces a rigid, impartial analysis framework: Verification Status (TRUE, FALSE, or MISLEADING) with separate sections for Supporting and Contradicting Evidence.

2. üß† The Premise Challenger App
Project Goal: Structured Critical Analysis and Dialogue

This app is a specialized critical thinking engine configured to promote constructive dialogue by synthesizing the strongest possible arguments across opposing viewpoints.

    Core Feature: Neutral Counterpoint Engine‚ÄîConfigured the LLM to provide balanced and objective analysis of any core thesis (e.g., economic or social claims) by generating two distinct, equally weighted perspectives.

    Output Model: Output is rigidly structured to provide distinct, evidence-based Counter-Arguments and Supporting Evidence, demonstrating proficiency in complex output schema design.

3.‚õ™ Catechism-Scripture Analyzer App
Project Goal: Deep Domain Expertise Applied to AI Synthesis

This application is a highly focused comparative analysis tool that extracts and cross-references complex concepts from two distinct, large-scale textual sources.

    Core Feature: Comparative Textual Synthesis‚ÄîDesigned a complex system prompt that instructs the LLM to search for and extract precise, correlated passages and citations from two distinct bodies of text based on a user-defined concept.

    Technical Value: Solves a unique data structuring and retrieval problem by leveraging deep domain expertise to define the specific analytical parameters, proving the ability to customize AI for highly specialized knowledge bases.
